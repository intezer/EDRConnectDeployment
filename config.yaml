## Authentication info
## Varies between different EDR types:
## S1 Example:
#authentication_info:
#  edr_api_key: <EDR_API_KEY>
#  edr_base_address: <EDR_BASE_ADDRESS>

## CS Example:
authentication_info:
  client_id: <EDR_CLIENT_ID>
  client_secret: <EDR_CLIENT_SECRET>

## Your Intezer Analyze API key
intezer_api_key: <INTEZER_API_KEY>

## Your EDR Type
## options: S1, CS
type: <EDR_TYPE>



## ssl verification for edr requests
## options: true, false
## default: true.
#ssl_verification: <SSL_VERIFICATION>


## The Connector fetches all the alerts that were created in the last <latest_edr_alerts_limit_in_hours> hours
## The app recognizes which alerts were already handled and will not reanalyze them
## This mainly influences 2 scenarios:
## 1. When running this app for the first time, how far back do you want to analyze your alerts
## 2. How long should we retry in case the analysis failed for some reason
##   (the endpoint machine is down so we couldn't fetch the file, timeout during fetching file etc.)
## default: 72 (hours)
#latest_edr_alerts_limit_in_hours: <LATEST_EDR_ALERTS_LIMIT_IN_HOURS>


## In order to lower quota consumption, The connector will try to use your previous analyses, if they exist
## This configuration influences how long your analyses remain valid before creating a new analysis
## Lower this to get the most up-to-date analyses
## Raise this to lower quota consumption even more (we would not advise rasing above 30)
## options: 1-90 (days)
## default: 30 (days)
#latest_analysis_limit_in_days: <LATEST-ANALYSIS-LIMIT_IN_DAYS>

## The cooldown between each iteration of the app
## After fetching and analyzing your analyses, the app goes to sleep before starting over
## Raise this is order to lower the number for requests to your EDR
## Lower this for faster notes and less 'dead time'
## options: 0-∞ (minutes)
## default: 3 (minutes)
#cooldown_in_minutes: <COOLDOWN_BETWEEN_RUNS_IN_MINUTES>


## HTTP timeout for requests to EDR
## default: 60 (seconds)
#http_timeout_in_seconds: <HTTP_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS>


## The number of times we should retry to fetch a file before block listing it.
## default: 3
#fetch_num_of_retires: <FETCH_NUM_OF_RETRIES>

# The password for file fetches from S1
# default: Infected1234
#fetch_file_password: <FETCH_FILE_PASSWORD>
